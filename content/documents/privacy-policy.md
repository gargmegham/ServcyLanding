# Privacy Notice

This notice applies across all websites that we own and operate and all services we provide, including our online and mobile software services products, and any other apps or services we may offer (our “services”)

When we say “personal data”, we mean information that would identify you, like your name, email, address, telephone number, bank account details, payment information and so on. The same would apply to information that could identify other users in your teams that are shared with Servcy.

If you can't be identified (for example, when personal data has been aggregated and anonymised), the information wouldn't be personal data anymore, and this notice doesn't apply.

We may need to update this notice from time to time. When a significant change is made, we'll make sure we let you know – usually by sending you an email.

# Clause 1: Who are “we”?

When we refer to “we” (or “our” or “us'), that means Servcy and all its wholly owned subsidiaries, including the primary operating entity, Servcy Our headquarters is located in Jagadhri. Address details for all Servcy offices are available on our “Contact Us” page.

For example, we may ask for your information and/or your colleagues' information to create an employee database for various purposes such as accounting and operations. If you don't want to provide us with personal data, you don't have to, but it might mean you can't use some parts of our product.

2. Information you provide to us directly: When you visit or use some parts of our websites and/or services, we might ask you to provide personal data to us.
